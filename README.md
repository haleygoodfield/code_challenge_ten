# My Tenth Coding Challenge
Hello again, everyone! This is my tenth coding project using JavaScript. Here, I will practice my JavaScript class-based object-oriented programming (OOP) skills by working with class structures, inheritance, and methods in a business-related inventory management system.
My project is split into 5 Tasks: 
+ Task 1: Creating a Product Class
+ Task 2: Creating an Order Class
+ Task 3: Creating an Inventory Class
+ Task 4: Implementing Order Management
+ Task 5: Implementing Product Restocking

I hope that you enjoy my attempt on the challenge!
